## [High-resolution Iterative Feedback Network for Camouflaged Object Detection（AAA23）](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11624.pdf)

The more qualitative results of HitNet on four benchmarks (CAMO, CHAMELEON, NC4K, COD10K) have already been stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dtsSXrFryBujpzXc7RX_ci2xnFPw5QzA/view?usp=sharing). <br>

The pretrained model is stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H3UeZzOk7KL7_-SkUvk6Qijjq_dQrE98/view?usp=share_link). After downloading, please put it in the pretrained_pvt fold.

Our well-trained model is stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XPncP4DyMgvPl-6NFQVuAahAXZngw6Vf/view?usp=share_link), which should be moved into the fold 'model_pth'. Google driver is out of service, please refer to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/stablediffusionuser/hitnet/tree/main).If you have any quesetion, please let me know!

run sh train.sh for training, test.sh for testing.
